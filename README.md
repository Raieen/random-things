# random things
This is a collection of random things that I've decided to put on GitHub. These things are pretty neat but they are not big enough to have their own repos.

## Note Stitch

Get all the images in a directory and generate a skeletal markdown file with the images ordered by their prefixes... Useful for markdown based note-taking.

## Market Wall

Inspired by some morning business show (Squawk on the street?) that has this board of some stock market and shows this board when it opens with green/red tiles to show if something is up/down where each tile represents some stock.

Created from an 1 hour coding challenge.
