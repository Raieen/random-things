# Flipbook Tool

This tool creates flipbooks given an mp4 file.



## Usage:

```
java -jar flipbook.jar inputFile [frameStart] frameEnd printImages outputFolder rows cols
```

inputFile - That's your input mp4 file

frameStart - what frame to start at, optional argument that defaults to 0 (ie. start at the beginning of the video file)

frameEnd - What frame to end at

printImages - print the images iff true

outputFolder - Where the generated images are outputted

rows - rows of frames in the generated image sheet

cols - columns of frames in the generated image sheet



Once the flipbook sheets are generated, print them out and start cutting. Use one of those paper chopping things to make it easier!
